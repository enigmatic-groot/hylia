From left, Andro Ogrodnik's mother with her sister. She is holding Andro in the picture. She is also known for the story of going into the fields to work, having a baby, and returning home that evening with a basket of vegetables and a new baby.

From right, Andro Ogrodnik was a guard for the Russian Czar. He went to America with the intention of bringing his wife and child, Rosy age 30 and Nickolas age 11, to America. This never happedned; Rosy became ill and died and Nickolas later became a medical Doctor in Russia, with no intent to come to America. Few letters were exchanged over the years.

grodnik means "Farmer" in Russian. Hopefully, the subsequent slides will bring back many good memories and for the younger generations a peak into the past. For the upcoming generations let this be a view of the strong, passionate lineage that is now part of their heritage, but most of all I hope it puts a smile on each face as we think of the day we will all be united with our Lord in Heaven. They loved their family, their country, and God.
